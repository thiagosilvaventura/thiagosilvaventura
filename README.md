### Rise, my friend!

Always say that my life is a search for <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>new challenges</strong>, Graduated in Data Science & Software Development in 2023, Graduated in architecture in 2019,and am passionate for mathematics,specially in <strong>series calculus</strong> and <strong>topology</strong>, currently working with quality assurance in social media deals. For a long time I worked on math and architecture projects, and now I'm starting with programming.

I'm starting with personal projects in maths with <strong> Phyton</strong> and <strong> CSS</strong>, and my projects are in my profile and files below. Here you will find my personal laboratory of programming projects and related areas of study!

Yours sincerely!
