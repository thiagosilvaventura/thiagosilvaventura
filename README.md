    <p>Hello, my name is Thiago, I live in Brazil, SÃ£o Paulo Capital. <span>&#x1F3E2;</span></p>
    <p>I have a degree in data science and software development, having pursued both degrees simultaneously between 2021 and 2023. I also have a degree in Architecture and Urbanism in 2019 and completed a postgraduate course in engineering in 2020.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold">Passions <span>&#x2764;</span></h2>
    <p>I have always been fascinated by mathematics, physics, and cosmology. This is how I have learned programming: developing scientific ideas in collaboration with technological tools. My hobbies include creating and solving calculus puzzles; I always say that this is my favorite game <span>&#x1F60E;</span>!</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold">Experiences <span>&#127908;</span></h2>
    <p>I worked for several years in customer interaction and technical support, where I learned a lot about agile methodologies and quality management. I believe that this type of knowledge can contribute significantly to the field of technology. I also worked in architecture, specifically in project coordination and technical drawing, always something related to technology!</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold">Skills <span>&#128218;</span></h2>
    <p>My favorite programming language is Python, and I have developed projects using this language. I also appreciate R and tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I always seek to stay updated on technology topics, and I am learning more about the C language group, including C, C++, and C#, as well as Swift and PHP.</p>
